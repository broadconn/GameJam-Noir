# GameJam-Noir
Made as part of a one-month long gamejam. The prompt was 'Noir': https://itch.io/jam/one-game-a-month-21

I decided I wanted to try something I haven't done before, and make a story-focused game that spans multiple locations.

## Development
Built in Unity 2022.2.12.

I added a dev tool under File menu -> \*\*Noir\*\* -> Dev Tools.<br/>This has handy things for each scene, such as:
- setting the point in the story you want to play from
- teleporting to specific story locations around the world
- changing shader values to make scene editing easier


## TODO (if I had more time)
- Build out the story
- Original music
- City life
  - e.g. Store fronts, cars, smalltalk with random citizens, debris etc.
- More interesting conversation sets
