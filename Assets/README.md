# Noir GameJam
## Development Tips:
- be sure to open the Dev Tools window: \*\*Noir**/Dev Tools
    - lets you play the game from any point (set the Story Pref)
    - it makes getting around the map easier (see City Spawn Points)
    - set the world shader bend amount
        - it helps to turn this to 0 when editing the world
- I recommend disabling the `BG Buildings` gameObject - Unity takes forever to start if this is enabled

## Todo:
- Finish the dialogue
- Conversation set pieces
- Music
