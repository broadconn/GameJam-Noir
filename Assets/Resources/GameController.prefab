    Dialogue: <Me>Here we go again.||The new client wanted to meet at the Midnight
      Diner in The Heights.|I've just arrived.||She wouldn't share any details over
      the phone.||Better get to it.|Diner's just up the street.

    Dialogue: "[You spot the client sitting in a corner booth, sipping a coffee.]||{show:BG,
      show:Wd, music}[She's wearing a muted overcoat and dark glasses, evidently
      trying to hide her opulence.]||[She bears a grim expression behind the steaming
      bean juice.]||[You sit at her table.]||<Wd>Hello detective.||{show:Me}<Me>I
      hear you have a case for me.||<Wd>Yes. You see, my husband passed away the
      day before last - traffic accident.||Witnesses say he walked into the road
      without looking.||Knowing my husband, this isn't entirely out of the question
      for him.||However, I have reason to believe it's not true.||The police assured
      me it was him, but the body was a mess. I couldn\u2019t be sure.||On top of
      this, I'm ashamed to say it but I recently discovered my husband had a mistress
      - ||I found a polaroid of them together a week ago.||[She slides the photo
      across the table]||The day before he died, a large sum of money was withdrawn
      from our account.||To me the evidence is clear. He faked his death to run away
      with this floozy.||I want you to help me prove it. ||<Me>I see. Any other leads
      ma'am?||[You're not sold on her theory.]||<Wd>Well - I suppose not. That's
      your job isn't it?||<Me>I suppose so. Where's the body now?||<Wd>Still at the
      morgue, I think. Near the docks.||Will you help me? I need to know the truth.||<Me>I
      can look into it. For a fee of course. You know my rates.||<Wd>I do.||[She
      slides you an envelope with your advance payment.]||<Me>Then I'll get to it."
